# Compilation

Nothing out of the ordinary, just your regular Qt-based configuration process:
* qmake BeTrains.Maemo.pro
* make

This gives you a nice BeTrains executable, which contains all the necessary resources as well.

# Packaging

This part is trickier, as the actual process varies depending on what type of package you want.

To build a binary package, ready to install:
* dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
This needs a proper build environment, which you can get by configuring a local Scratchbox installation (and switching to the armel target), or by installing Nokia's QtSDK and using MADDE (by prefixing all commands with the "mad" binary).

To build a binary package you want to upload to the Ovi store, you need to change the Debian control file before building: the section needs to be "user/hidden".

To create a package ready for the autobuilder, you need to generate a source package:
* dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -sa -S
